## Ridgeline

 Can also be called joyplots

- A ridgeline plot is cmbination of a density plot or a histogram plot divided throug several categories.

- Both plots represents the density of a specific value on the x axis witch means how many possible times did this value occurs on this specific area.
- Density plot uses a kernel density estimation to calculates the probable density at several points
- Histogram plot devides the data into bins to calculate how many points does this value fall into a specific bin


- If we Apply a Density plot or a histogram on a number of categories we become a ridgeline plot.

# Aesthetics used:
- Position
- Density/Size
- Colour

# Potential pitfalls:
- Overlapping
- The use of discreate data


# Why is continuous data typically preferred for use in ridgeline plots?

- A) Continuous data allows for easier labeling of categories on the x-axis.

- B) Continuous data allows for smoother density estimation using a mathematical approach.

- C) Continuous data results in fewer overlapping density curves, improving plot readability.

- D) Continuous data leads to more distinct gaps between density curves.
